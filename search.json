You will review key skills from DATA 271, practice reading and navigating a computational notebook, and begin building a personal quick reference you can return to all semester.\nThis lab is not about learning new machine learning algorithms. Instead, the focus is on:\n\nTranslating information into data a machine can use\nUnderstanding how data is structured for the libraries we’ll be using\nReviewing essential wrangling and visualization skills"

Loading Data from a .csv\nIn Colab, you’ll have to upload the dataset first using the file manager on the left side bar.\n\n\n2. Checking Objects and Data Structures\nExamples may include:\n\nChecking object types\nViewing dimensions or shape\nInspecting column names\n\n\n\n3. Creating a Design Matrix (X)\nExamples may include:\n\nSelecting predictor variables\nEnsuring all values are numeric\nConfirming dimensions are appropriate\n\n\n\n4. Defining a Response (y)\nExamples may include:\n\nExtracting a single variable as a response and checking that it is numeric\nEnsuring shape is appropriate for an X\n\n\n\n5. Descriptive Statistics\nExamples may include:\n\nmeasures of center and spread\nhistogram\nbar plot\nstacked bar plot\nscatterplot\nboxplot\n\nThis quick reference is meant to be useful to you later in the course. Clarity and usefulness matter more than length."
