Topics include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and best practices in machine learning. The course draws from numerous case studies and applications, with a practical rather than theoretical emphasis.\nWeekly: Lecture 3 hrs. Activity 2 hrs.\nPrerequisites: DATA 271, MATH 107, STAT 109\nA minimum grade of C- is required for the course to count toward the Data Science major.\n\n\n\n\n(Note, students can find program learning outcomes on the program website, and institution learning outcomes here: https://academicprograms.humboldt.edu/content/baccalaureate-student-learning-outcomes)\n(1) Students will demonstrate computational skills to extract different types and quantities of data from multiple sources and create visualizations and other data products for various audiences. (ILO 3,4,7)\nIn order to achieve PLO 1, students will demonstrate the following specific measurable behaviors:\n\n(SLO 1) Students will extract quantitative and categorical data from a large public database, calculate relevant summary statistics, and present findings numerically and graphically for in-class individual and group data projects.\n\n(2) Students will demonstrate statistical knowledge to build mathematical models and ensure the validity of data and its analysis. (ILO 7)\nIn order to achieve PLO 2, students will demonstrate the following specific measurable behaviors:\n\n(SLO 2) Students will design a mathematical (logic) model to guide analysis and ensure valid and reliable results for in-class individual and group data projects.\n\n(5) Students will communicate effectively with a diverse range of audiences. (ILO 5,6)\nIn order to achieve PLO 5, students will demonstrate the following specific measurable behaviors:\n\n(SLO 5a) Students will prepare a written description of a mathematical model in which they explain the context, describe their methodology, analyze their data, and reach a conclusion that includes a discussion of its implications.\n\nAdditionally, one of students’ two projects, communicated in written form, will be the application of Machine Learning algorithms (supervised and unsupervised, respectively) to a data set related to one of the following: sustainability, social justice, or Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). This project supports ILOs (1) and (2).\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nRecognize the characteristics of machine learning that make it useful for real-world problems.\nExplain how machine learning differs from inferential statistical modeling.\nCharacterize machine learning algorithms as supervised and unsupervised.\nImplement common machine learning algorithms using Python-based toolkits.\nApply regression, classification, and clustering methods to real data sets.\nEvaluate model performance and select appropriate models based on context and goals.\nCommunicate modeling choices, results, and limitations to a variety of audiences.\nIdentify and discuss ethical considerations related to data collection, modeling, and algorithmic decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course supports the Data Science Program Learning Outcomes and Cal Poly Humboldt’s Institutional Learning Outcomes related to quantitative reasoning, critical thinking, communication, and ethical reasoning.\n\n\n\n\nDATA 322 includes:\n\nThree weekly lecture meetings\nOne weekly laboratory session\n\nIn this 4-unit course, students should expect to spend approximately 12 hours per week on course-related work. This includes time in lecture (3 hours), lab time (2 hours), and time outside of class to complete readings, assignments, projects, and exam preparation (approximately 7 hours).\n\n\n\n\nTextbook:\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python\nAvailable free online or for purchase in print.\nSoftware:\nPython and commonly used data science libraries (installed on all campus computers)\nOther Technology:\nRegular access to a computer with reliable internet\nStudents without personal access to required technology may use campus computer labs and library resources.\n\n\n\n\nStudents enter DATA 322 with different backgrounds in statistics, mathematics, and programming. That’s expected. You do not need to be an expert at the start of the semester to succeed in this course. What matters most is steady engagement and a willingness to practice, reflect, and ask questions.\nStudents who are successful in this course typically:\n\nAttend lecture and lab regularly.\nClass time is used to build intuition, practice ideas, and work through examples that are difficult to learn independently.\nParticipate actively in daily warm-ups.\nWarm-ups are designed to help you engage with your classmates and develop conceptual understanding and confidence before moving to more complex problems.\nUse labs as a space to practice and make mistakes.\nLabs are meant for learning, not perfection. Comparing your work to posted results and reflecting on differences is an important part of the learning process.\nPrepare consistently for weekly quizzes.\nQuizzes are short and predictable, but they require regular practice. Reviewing lecture notes, lab activities, and assigned textbook problems each week will help you succeed.\nStart projects early and work iteratively.\nProjects are most successful when you begin early, test ideas incrementally, and seek feedback along the way. I’ve deliberately chosen two projects that reflect significant problems with real applications of ML. At first glance, the datasets might appear simple but great care is required to build useful products out of them. Rather than tell you a solution to implement, I’m going to use our class time to guide class discussions so that students will be active participants in creating appropriate solutions.\nCollaborate appropriately with classmates.\nDiscussing ideas and approaches is encouraged, but all submitted work must reflect your own understanding unless otherwise specified.\nAsk for help when you need it.\nIf you are struggling with course material, please reach out during office hours, lab sessions, or by email. Seeking help early can make a significant difference.\n\nAs a general guideline, you should plan to spend approximately three hours per week per unit on course-related work, including time in class and time outside of class. For this 4-unit course, this corresponds to about 12 hours per week total. Individual experiences will vary, but this can be a helpful frame of reference when planning your time.\n\n\n\n\nStudents will complete a variety of assessments designed to support regular practice, provide regular feedback, and evaluate mastery of machine learning concepts and methods.\nAssessments in this course include:\n\nDaily warm-up problems during lecture (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays).\nThese short activities are designed to help students engage with new concepts, build intuition, and practice explaining ideas with peers. Warm-ups are graded on participation.\nWeekly programming labs.\nLabs provide guided, hands-on practice implementing machine learning methods using Python. Labs are intended as formative learning experiences. I’ll provide desired outputs so students can check their work and reflect on their understanding before turning in their work. Labs will be graded on completion.\nEarly in the semester, you will complete a mini project as part of the weekly labs. This project introduces the full workflow of an applied machine learning task in a simplified and supported setting. Using a provided Google Colab notebook, the class will modify an existing recommender system to form study groups based on survey responses collected from real participants.\nThe goal of this mini project is not to produce perfect groupings, but to practice:\n\nDesigning questions that can be translated into quantitative features\nExplore distance metrics\nApplying and interpreting clustering algorithms\nWorking collaboratively with a shared product\nReflecting on modeling decisions and their consequences\n\nThis experience is designed to make the larger course projects more approachable and to build confidence before tackling more complex open-ended problems.\nWeekly quizzes during lab sessions.\nQuizzes assess understanding of both lab material and assigned practice problems. Quiz questions may include conceptual questions, mathematical calculations, interpretation of output or visualizations, and short problem-solving tasks. Quizzes are designed to encourage steady preparation and synthesis of ideas.\nTwo projects.\nProjects require students to apply machine learning methods to real data, justify modeling choices, evaluate performance, and communicate results in written form. Projects emphasize modeling choices, interpretation, and communication and may be used as part of a professional portfolio.\n\nUnsupervised Learning Project:\nIn this project, you will use unsupervised learning techniques to build a major recommender system for Cal Poly Humboldt using publicly available data. The goal is to explore and justify modeling choices, and communicate the resulting recommendations clearly and responsibly.\nSupervised Learning Project:\nIn this project, you will work with data from a one-dimensional simulation of a fusion reactor to develop a model to predict the onset of instabilities before they occur. This project emphasizes feature engineering, computational efficiency and valid model evaluation in an effort to help further research in California’s renewable energy sector.\n\nOne midterm exam and one final exam.\nExams assess students’ ability to reason about machine learning methods, interpret results, compare approaches, and understand limitations. Exams focus on conceptual understanding rather than memorization of code syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nDaily Participation (Warm-ups)\n5%\n\n\nWeekly Quizzes\n25%\n\n\nWeekly Labs\n15%\n\n\nTwo Projects\n30%\n\n\nMidterm Exam\n10%\n\n\nFinal Exam\n15%\n\n\nTotal\n100%\n\n\n\nFinal letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale:\nA: 93–100% | A-: 90–92% | B+: 87–89% | B: 83–86% | B-: 80–82% | C+: 77–79% | C: 73–76% | C-: 70–72% | D: 60–69% | F: 0–59%\nGrades are recorded in Canvas. Canvas grades are not official until finalized at the end of the semester.\n\n\n\n\nRegular attendance and active participation are expected and essential for success in this course. Attendance in lecture and lab will be reflected in participation activities and assignments.\nIf you must miss class, you are responsible for obtaining notes and keeping up with course material.\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily warm-ups are graded on participation and cannot be made up if missed.\nWeekly labs are due on the posted deadlines in Canvas. Late submissions may be accepted in documented emergencies; otherwise, late work policies will be specified per lab.\nWeekly quizzes are administered during lab sessions. If you need to miss a quiz due to illness or other emergencies, please contact me to make an arrangement to take it at another time.\nProjects are due on the specified dates in Canvas. Late project policies will be specified per project.\nExams must be taken on the scheduled date unless arrangements are made in advance due to illness or emergency.\n\nTechnology issues are not automatically considered valid excuses for late or missed work.\n\n\n\n\n\nData preprocessing skills from DATA 271\nIntroduction to machine learning\nUnsupervised learning\nTraditional supervised learning methods\nModel evaluation and validation\nModern supervised learning methods\nFeature engineering & computational efficiency\nEthical considerations and appropriate communication of results\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for reviewing the Cal Poly Humboldt Syllabus Addendum, which includes policies and resources related to:\n\nAcademic honesty\nDisability accommodations\nEmergency procedures\nTitle IX\nStudent conduct and support services\n\nThe Syllabus Addendum is available on the Cal Poly Humboldt website.\n\n\n\n\nStudents who wish to request disability-related accommodations should contact the Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC) as early as possible and then email me your letter of accommodation.\n\n\n\n\nStandards of respectful and professional behavior apply to all course interactions, including in-person classes, assignments, and email communication.\n\n\n\n\nThis syllabus is subject to change. Any changes will be communicated through Canvas announcements."

    "text": "Students will complete a variety of assessments designed to support regular practice, provide regular feedback, and evaluate mastery of machine learning concepts and methods.\nAssessments in this course include:\n\nDaily warm-up problems during lecture (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays).\nThese short activities are designed to help students engage with new concepts, build intuition, and practice explaining ideas with peers. Warm-ups are graded on participation.\nWeekly programming labs.\nLabs provide guided, hands-on practice implementing machine learning methods using Python. Labs are intended as formative learning experiences. I’ll provide desired outputs so students can check their work and reflect on their understanding before turning in their work. Labs will be graded on completion.\nEarly in the semester, you will complete a mini project as part of the weekly labs. This project introduces the full workflow of an applied machine learning task in a simplified and supported setting. Using a provided Google Colab notebook, the class will modify an existing recommender system to form study groups based on survey responses collected from real participants.\nThe goal of this mini project is not to produce perfect groupings, but to practice:\n\nDesigning questions that can be translated into quantitative features\nExplore distance metrics\nApplying and interpreting clustering algorithms\nWorking collaboratively with a shared product\nReflecting on modeling decisions and their consequences\n\nThis experience is designed to make the larger course projects more approachable and to build confidence before tackling more complex open-ended problems.\nWeekly quizzes during lab sessions.\nQuizzes assess understanding of both lab material and assigned practice problems. Quiz questions may include conceptual questions, mathematical calculations, interpretation of output or visualizations, and short problem-solving tasks. Quizzes are designed to encourage steady preparation and synthesis of ideas.\nTwo projects.\nProjects require students to apply machine learning methods to real data, justify modeling choices, evaluate performance, and communicate results in written form. Projects emphasize modeling choices, interpretation, and communication and may be used as part of a professional portfolio.\n\nUnsupervised Learning Project:\nIn this project, you will use unsupervised learning techniques to build a major recommender system for Cal Poly Humboldt using publicly available data. The goal is to explore and justify modeling choices, and communicate the resulting recommendations clearly and responsibly.\nSupervised Learning Project:\nIn this project, you will work with data from a one-dimensional simulation of a fusion reactor to develop a model to predict the onset of instabilities before they occur. This project emphasizes feature engineering, computational efficiency and valid model evaluation in an effort to help further research in California’s renewable energy sector.\n\nOne midterm exam and one final exam.\nExams assess students’ ability to reason about machine learning methods, interpret results, compare approaches, and understand limitations. Exams focus on conceptual understanding rather than memorization of code syntax."
